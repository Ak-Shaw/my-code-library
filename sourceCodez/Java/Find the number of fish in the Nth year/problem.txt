Problem Description
You need to find the number of fish there will be at a year N, given the initial number NB of fish at year 0. To simplify things, there are no males and females: every fish gives birth to G fish per year.

But be careful, because:

Fish only give birth during the first R years of their lives

Fish only live L years (initial fish are dead at year L)

Input format
N NB G L R

Output format
Number of fish in year N

Sample Input 1

1 2 1 4 2

Sample Output 1

4

Explanation 1
Initial 2 fish plus each of their babies(1 each) hence total of 4.

Sample Input 2

3 2 2 4 2

Sample Output 2

50

Constraints
0 < N,NB,G <= 10

0 < R <= L <= 5
