Problem Description
Given a string, find the length of its Longest Palindromic Substring.

In a palindromic string, elements read the same backward and forward.

Input format
First line contains T, the number of test cases.

First line of each test case contains integer N, the length of the String.

Second line of each test case contains the string S.

Output format
Print the length of the longest palindromic substring for each test case on a separate line.

Constraints
T <= 20

N <= 500

Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 1000.

Sample Input 1
2
6
abcpca
3
abc

Sample Output 1
3
1

Explanation 1
In the 1st test case, the string 'cpc' is palindromic with length 3.

In the 2nd test case, 'a' can be considered as a palindrome with length 1.
