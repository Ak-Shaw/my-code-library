Problem Description
Write a program that will output the kth smallest permutation of an alphabet sequence of length N in English uppercase alphabets.

Given: Uppercase alphabets of length N = 1 is A, length N = 2 is AB , length N = 3 is ABC and so on.

All permutations of the above sequence with length 3 are (in order):

ABC

ACB

BAC

BCA

CAB

CBA

Input format
First line contains two integers representing the value of N and K, where N is the length of the alphabet sequence and the Kth permutation respectively.

Output format
Print a single string in capital letters representing the kth permutation of the Alphabets.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 18

1 <= K <= X, Where X is the value of N factorial.
