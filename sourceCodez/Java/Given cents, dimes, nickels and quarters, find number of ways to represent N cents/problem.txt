Problem Description
Given an infinite number of quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents) and pennies (1 cent), calculate the number of ways of representing N cents.

Note: The combination of denominations is what is important. The order doesnâ€™t matter. For example, Nickel + Penny + Penny = 7 Cents or Penny + Nickel + Penny = 7 Cents, are both considered a single way of counting to 7 Cents since they have the same combination.

Input format
First and only line will contain a number N, representing N cents.

Output format
Number showing the total number of ways, modulo 1e9+7.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000000

Sample Input 1
5

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation 1
