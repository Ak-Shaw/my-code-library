Problem Description
A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> 1

'B' -> 2

...

'Z' -> 26

Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 1000000007.

Input format
Single line with the string

Output format
Number of ways to decode modulo 1000000007

Constraints
1 <= String length <= 5000

Sample Input 1
15

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation 1
We can decode the string in these 2 ways - AE (since A is 1 and E is 5) or O (since O is 15).

Sample Input 2
157

Sample Output 2
2

Explanation 2
We can only decode the string in 2 ways - AEG (since A is 1, E is 5 and G is 7) or OG (since O is 15 and G is 7)

We cannot split it into 1 and 57 since no letter represents 57

We cannot decode with 157 as a whole since no letter represents 157
