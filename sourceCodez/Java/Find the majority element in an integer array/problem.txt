Problem Description
The majority element in an array of size N is the element that appears more than floor(N/2) times. Given a non-empty array which is guaranteed to have a majority element in it, find it.

Input format
First line contains an integer representing the value of N.

Second line contains N space separated numbers which are the input array elements.

Output format
Print the majority element. If there is no majority element, print -1.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000000

1 <= A[i] <= 1000000

Sample Input 1
6
1 2 1 2 1 1

Sample Output 1
1

Explanation 1
The frequency of 1 is more than half the size of the array. So, it is the majority element.
