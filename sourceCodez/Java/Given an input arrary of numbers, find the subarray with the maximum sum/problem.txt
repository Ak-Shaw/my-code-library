Problem Description
Write a program to find the sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.

Note: Such a contiguous subarray should have at least one number i.e. empty subarray is not allowed.

Input format
First line contains N, the number of elements in the array.

Second line contains N space separated numbers, representing the array elements.

Output format
A single integer which is the maximum possible contiguous subarray sum

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5

-10^9 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9

Sample Input 1
8
-2 -3 4 -1 -2 1 5 -3

Sample Output 1
7

Explanation 1
If we take the contiguous subarray [4 -1 -2 1 5], this subarray has a sum of 7, which is the maximum possible sum.
