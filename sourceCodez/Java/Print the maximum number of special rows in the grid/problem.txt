Problem Description
There is a grid of size N X M with values 0 or 1 in each cell. You also have a Rectangular sheet of size 1 * K with values 1 in each cell.

You can place the sheet above the grid and cover some cells.

You have to place it in such a way that there are maximum special rows in the grid.

A special row in the grid is a row that contains all ones in that particular row.

Return the maximum number of special rows in the grid by placing the sheet.

NOTE: The sheet can only be placed horizontally.

Input format
The first line contains 1 single integer the number of test cases.

In each test case : The first line contains 3 space separated integers N, M and K.

Next N Line contains M space separated integers the values of the matrix.

Output format
Print the maximum number of special rows in the grid by placing the sheet.

Sample Input 1
1
4 4 3
1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation 1
We can either place the sheet in the first row, third row or in the last row to get the maximum value of two special rows.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N,M <= 1000
1 <= K <= M
Sum of all values over all test cases is less than 5*10^5.
