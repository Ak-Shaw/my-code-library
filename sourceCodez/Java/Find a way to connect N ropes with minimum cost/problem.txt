Problem Description
You are given N ropes of varying lengths. The cost of connecting any two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths. Your goal is to connect all N ropes together to form a single rope and minimize the cost in the process.

Input format
First line will contain the value N, denoting the number of ropes

Second line will contain N space separated integers

Output format
Print the minimum cost on a single line

Constraints
1 <= N <= 200000

1<= Length of each Rope <= 10000000

Sample Input 1

3
1 2 3

Sample Output 1

9

Explanation 1
First, we connect ropes of length 1 and 2, leading to a new rope of length 3 and which costs 1+2 = 3. Next we connect ropes of length 3 and 3, leading to a single rope, costing 3+3 = 6. The total cost will be 3+6 = 9, which is the minimum possible cost.

Sample Input 2

4
3 3 6 10

Sample Output 2

40

Explanation 2
First, we connect ropes of length 3 and 3, leading to a new rope of length 6 and which costs 3+3 = 6.

Next we connect ropes of length 6 and 6, leading to a new rope of length 12, costing 6+6 = 12.

Finally, we connect the remaining two ropes of length 10 and 12, leading to a single rope and costing 10+12 = 22.

The total cost will be 6+12+22 = 40, which is the minimum possible cost.
