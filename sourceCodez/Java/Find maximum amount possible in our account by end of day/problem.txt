Problem Description

Exchange rules are:

Only onions are traded on exchange. Price of onion changes during the day, each new value of a price is called tick.

You can buy onions for all money that you have on your account and sell all onions back later starting from the next tick. Only one buy-sell operation is allowed per day. If you buy onions you must sell them later. If price is not a divisor of the amount of money that you have then you receive a fractional number (balance / price) of onions.
