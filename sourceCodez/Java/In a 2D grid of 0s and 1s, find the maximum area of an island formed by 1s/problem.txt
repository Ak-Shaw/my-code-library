Problem Description
Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0s and 1s, an island is a group of 1s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water. Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0).

Input format
First line contains 2 space separated integers N and M, representing the number of rows and columns respectively.

Next N lines contain M space separated integers which can be 0 or 1.

Output format
Print the area of the island having maximum area.

Constraints
Length of each dimension in the grid does not exceed 500

Sample Input 1

3 5
1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 1 1

Sample Output 1

4

Explanation 1
There are 2 islands in this example, one with area 3 and the other with area 4. So the answer is 4.
