Problem Description
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Note: The merged intervals should be printed in sorted order (using interval start as the key)

Input format
First line contains N, the number of intervals

Next N lines contain 2 space separated integers A and B, which represent the start and end of an interval

Output format
For the X merged intervals, print each interval (the start and end being space separated) on a separate line

Constraints
1 <= N <= 50000

0 <= A, B <= 1e9

B >= A

Sample Input 1

4
1 3
2 6
8 10
15 18

Sample Output 1

1 6
8 10
15 18

Explanation 1
Since intervals [1 3] and [2 6] overlap, merge them into [1 6]

Sample Input 2

2
1 4
4 5

Sample Output 2

1 5

Explanation 2
Intervals [1 4] and [4 5] overlap and get merged into [1 5]
