Problem Description
You are given an array of N numbers. Take subarrays of increasing size (subarray always starts from the first element), starting from size 1 to size N from this input array and for each subarray, find the median and print it on a separate line.

The median is defined as the middle element of an array, sorted in ascending order.

For an array with an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element

Example 1 - For the array 1 2 3 4 5, the median is 3

For an array with an even number of elements, the median is defined as (Element at index floor(n/2) + Element at index (floor(n/2)+1))/2

Example 2 - For the array 1 2 4 5, the median is (2+4)/2 = 3

Input format
First line will contain an integer N denoting the size of the array

Next line will contain N space separated integers

Output format
Print median for every subarray of size 1 <= i <= N on a new line.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 200000

0 <= Array values <= 1e9

Sample Input 1

5
1 2 1 2 3

Sample Output 1

1
1
1
1
2

Explanation 1
First subarray to consider is [1], which has a median of 1

Next subarray to consider is [1 2], which has a median of 1 (since we are expecting integer output, otherwise it wouldâ€™ve been 1.5)

Next subarray to consider is [1 2 1], which has a median of 1, when the subarray is sorted

Next subarray to consider is [1 2 1 2], which has a median of 1, when the subarray is sorted

Next subarray to consider is [1 2 1 2 3], which has a median of 2, when the subarray is sorted
