Problem Description
You are given K sorted linked lists. Merge these K sorted lists into one big sorted list in an optimal way and return the head to the new list.

Input format
First line will contain the value K, denoting the number of lists

For each of the K lists, weâ€™ll have 2 lines. One line having N, the number of elements in that list and the next line containing N space separated integers.

Output format
Print out the merged sorted list

Constraints
1 <= K <= 100000

1 <= N <= 100000

1 <= List node values <= 1e9

Sample Input 1

3
3
1 4 5
3
1 3 4
2
2 6

Sample Output 1

1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6

Explanation 1
The input has 3 lists with [1 4 5], [1 3 4] and [2 6]. Merging these into a single sorted list gives us [1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6]
