Problem Description
Given a string, we want to cut it into pieces such that each piece is a palindrome. Write a function to return the number of cuts needed to break the string into the minimum possible number of palindromes.

Note: A single letter is also considered a palindrome.

Note: The function needs to return the number of cuts, not the minimum number of palindromes

Input format
First line contains N, the length of the string S.

Second line contains the string S of length N characters, consisting of all lowercase alphabets.

Output format
Print the number of cuts needed.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 2000

Sample Input 1
8
aabbaacd

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation 1
We can make two cuts to get the minimum number of palindrome strings - aabbaa|c|d

Sample Input 2
4
abcd

Sample Output 2
3

Explanation 2
Each character will become a separate palindrome since there is no other longer palindrome possible. We need to make 3 cuts to separate the string into palindromes - a|b|c|d

Sample Input 3
3
aaa

Sample Output 3
0

Explanation 3
The string is a palindrome in itself. We can have 0 cuts to end up with a single palindrome which is the minimum possible.
