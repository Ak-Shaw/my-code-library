Bit Manipulation is needed.

Write down a couple of examples and visualize what cases need the flips

Can we use XOR to figure out a simple logic that can count the number of flips needed?

CountNumBitsToFlip (A, B) {

Calculate the XOR of A and B. This will only have set bits where A and B differ.

Count the number of 1 bits in this XORed result.

This is the required number. Return this.
