Problem Description
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first position of the array. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last position.

Input format
First line contains N, the size of the array

Second line contains N space separated integers representing the array

Output format
If it is possible to reach the last position, print 'true', else print 'false'

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000000

0 <= a[i] <= N-1

Sample Input 1
4
5 1 2 3

Sample Output 1
true

Explanation 1
Starting from the first position, we can jump a maximum of 5 positions. This means we can reach the last position which only needs 3 jumps. So, true.

Sample Input 2
4
1 0 5 4

Sample Output 2
false

Explanation 2
Starting from the first position, we can only jump one position and we reach the second position which has 0 jumps. We cannot go further from here to reach the last position, so false.
