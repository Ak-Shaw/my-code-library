Problem Description
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a goodness value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.

Children with a higher goodness get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum number of candies you have to give?

Input format
First line contains the number N, denoting the number of children.

Second line contains N space separated numbers where the ith number denotes the goodness of the ith child.

Output format
A number denoting the minimum number of candies to be given to the children.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000

0 <= Gi <= 100000000

Sample Input 1
3
1 0 2

Sample Output 1
5

Explanation 1
All three children get 1 candy each to start with. First child with goodness 1 needs to get 1 more than the right neighbor with goodness 0, so the first child gets 2.

The third kid with goodness 2 needs to get 1 more than the left neighbor with goodness 0, so the third child gets 2.

Total = first child (2) + second child (1) + third child (2) = 5
