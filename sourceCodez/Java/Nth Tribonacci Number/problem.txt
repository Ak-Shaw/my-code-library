Problem Description
The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows:

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.

Overall the sequence looks like this - 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81 â€¦

Given n, return the value of Tn.

Input format
The Integer n

Output format
The integer value of Tn

Constraints
0 <= n <= 15

Sample Input 1
4

Sample Output 1
4

Explanation 1
T3 = T2 + T1 + T0 = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

T4 = T3 + T2 + T1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
