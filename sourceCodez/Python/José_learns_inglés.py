Problem statement
José is from South America and hence, Spanish is his mother tongue. He wants to 
travel around the world and, therefore, decides to learn various languages, 
starting with English. He tries to learn the alphabetical order.. You being 
a good teacher will help him in doing so. He said he would learn just by 
asking questions. You have to answer his questions. You will be given 
few characters. You need to arrange them in alphabetical order and print them.
NOTE: Do not mind the case. (example : 'D' will come after 'a' in alphabetical order)
Input
First line of input is N, the number of characters.
Next line contains N space-separated characters.
Output
Print the characters in ascending form
Constraint
1 ≤ N ≤ 26
It is guaranteed that no character will be repeated.
Sample Input
4
D c a M
Sample Output
a c D M

'''
the character array c[] stores the alphabets
entered and the integer array b[] stores
their respective positional values
i.e. 1 for 'a' or 'A', 2 for 'b' or 'B'
and so on

for q in c:
	t=ord(q)
	if t>64 and t<91:
		b.append(t-64)
	if t>96 and t<123:
		b.append(t-96)

'''
applying bubble sort to the
array b[] and also swapping the
characters of c[] at respective
positions
