PROJECT TITLE: Series
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create the sum of a series through the iteration produced by a loop.
VERSION or DATE: 2013
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
For creating a series the most basic way is to understand the logic and
create a loop which follows a single iterative process and to form a 
formula which will follow the sequence in providing the specified result.
AUTHORS: Ayush Kumar Shaw
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
/* The following series and their sum are :-
b + b + b + b +...........+ Nth term
Sum = b + b + b + b +...........+ Nth term
*/
public class SeriesN
{
public static void main(int n)
{
int i,b,s=0;
for(i=o;i<=n;i++)
{
b=Formula;
s=s+b;
System.out.print(" "+(int)b);
}
System.out.println("\n Sum = "+s);
}
}
