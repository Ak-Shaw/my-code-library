Complexity analysis
--------------------

1. Big-O: O (Loose Upper Bound) [Most Frequently used]
2. Big-Ω: Ω (Loose Lower Bound)
3. Big-θ: θ (Tight Bound) [Most informative]
4. Small-o: o (Tight Upper Bound)
5. Small-omega: ω (Tight Lower Bound)

------------------------------------------------------

For example, let's take O(n). It means that the 
dependence on the complexity is <= n.
