A super class Record has been defined to store the names and
ranks of 50 students. Define a sub class Rank to find the highest
rank along with the name. The details of both classes are given
below:

Class name : Record
Data Members / instance variables:
name[ ] : to store the names of students
rnk[ ] : to store the ranks of students
Member functions:
Record() : constructor to initialize data members
void readvalues() : to store names and ranks
void display() : displays the names and the corresponding ranks

Class name : Rank
Data Members / instance variables:
index : integer to store the index of the topmost rank
Member functions
Rank() : constructor to invoke the base class constructor and
to initialize index to 0.
void highest() : finds the index location of the topmost rank and
stores it in index without sorting the array
void display() : displays the name and ranks along with the
name having the topmost rank.

Specify the class Record giving details of the constructor(), void
readvalues(), void display(). Using the concept of inheritance,
specify the class Rank giving details of constructor(), void
highest() and void display().
