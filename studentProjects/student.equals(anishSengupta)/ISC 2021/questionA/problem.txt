A super class Perimeter has been defined to calculate the perimeter of a parallelogram. 
Define a sub class Area to compute the area of the parallelogram by using the required 
datamembers of the super class. 

The details are given below:
Class name : Perimeter
Data members/instance variables:
a: to store the length in decimal
b: to store the breadth in decimal

Member functions:
Perimeter( ... ): parameterized constructor to assign values to datamembers
double Calculate( ): calculate and return the perimeter of a parallelogram as 2 * (length + breadth)
void show(): to display the data members along with the perimeter of the parallelogram

Class name: Area
Data members/instance variables:
h: to store the height in decimal
area: to store the area of the parallelogram

Member functions:
Area( ... ): parameterized constructor to assign values to datamembers of both the classes
void doarea( ): compute the area as (breadth * height)
void show(): display the data members of both classes alongwith the area and perimeter of the parallelogram.

Specify the class Perimeter giving details of the constructor( ... ), void Calculate( ) and 
void show( ). Using the concept of inheritance, specify the class Area giving details of 
the constructor( ... ), void doarea( ) and void show( ).
